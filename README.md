The first deployable Generative AI example from this: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kXuHxI5ZcG0

the AI Anytime YouTube channel (https://www.youtube.com/@AIAnytime/videos) has published this deployable medical encyclopaedia-based generative AI chatbot.

The basis of this video was to use open-source as much as possible.  We use a quantized Llama2-based AI model which is going to run from CPU rather than GPU.  We use Chainlit, Faiss, and Langchain leveraging what HuggingFace makes available.

I'll add more details if required, but I do not take any more credit other than trying to deploy the example myself.  The full credit goes to AI Anytime (links above).
